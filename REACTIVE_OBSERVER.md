# ReactiveObserver Review

## Overview

The `ReactiveObserver` interface provides a comprehensive event system for tracking reactive state changes, mutations, actions, and effects in the ReactX library.

## What ReactiveObserver Can Observe

The `ReactiveObserver` interface tracks 9 event types through the `onEvent` method:

### Event Types

1. **`init`** - Initial state and configuration
   - Sent when devtools observer is initialized
   - Contains initial state, actions, delimiter, and feature flags

2. **`state`** - Property value changes on custom class instances
   - Emitted when a property value changes via autorun tracking
   - Includes path, value, and whether it's a mutation
   - Location: `proxy.ts:304-311`

3. **`mutation`** - Direct property mutations and array method calls (within actions)
   - Tracks setter calls on observed properties
   - Tracks array mutating methods (push, pop, shift, unshift, splice, sort, reverse)
   - Includes action context (actionId, executionId, operatorId)
   - Location: `proxy.ts:148-166`, `proxy.ts:578-594`

4. **`derived`** - Computed/getter evaluations on custom classes
   - Emitted when computed properties (getters without setters) are accessed
   - Includes path, value, and update count
   - Location: `proxy.ts:221-229`

5. **`action:start`** - Method execution begins on reactive classes
   - Emitted when a method on a custom class instance is called
   - Includes actionId, executionId, action name, path, and arguments
   - Location: `proxy.ts:465-475`

6. **`action:end`** - Method execution completes
   - Emitted when action finishes (both sync and async)
   - Includes actionId and executionId
   - Location: `proxy.ts:502-508`, `proxy.ts:539-545`

7. **`operator:start`** - Operator execution begins within actions
   - Emitted at the start of action execution
   - Includes operator metadata (id, name, type)
   - Location: `proxy.ts:476-487`

8. **`operator:end`** - Operator execution completes
   - Emitted when operator finishes (tracks async status)
   - Can include error information for failed operators
   - Location: `proxy.ts:493-501`, `proxy.ts:530-538`

9. **`effect`** - Effects called on custom class instances during actions
   - Emitted when methods on custom class instances are called within action context
   - Includes effect details (method, args, result, error status)
   - Location: `proxy.ts:416-430`

## Identified Issues & Missing Functionality

### Critical Issues

#### 1. Observer Cannot Be Changed Per Proxy

**Location**: `proxy.ts:362-374`

**Issue**: The `proxyCache` uses the unwrapped target as key. If the same object is made reactive with different observers, the cache returns the first proxy created.

```typescript
const cachedProxy = proxyCache.get(unwrappedTarget);
if (cachedProxy) {
  return cachedProxy;
}
```

**Impact**: Observer options are essentially global per object. You cannot create multiple reactive proxies of the same object with different observers.

**Example**:
```typescript
const obj = { count: 0 };
const proxy1 = reactive(obj, { observer: observerA });
const proxy2 = reactive(obj, { observer: observerB }); // Returns proxy1, ignoring observerB
```

#### 2. Memory Leak: No Autorun Cleanup

**Location**: `proxy.ts:279-316`

**Issue**: Autoruns created for tracking state changes are never disposed. These will continue running even if the proxy is no longer used.

```typescript
autorun(() => {
  const newValue = boxedValue.get();
  // ... tracking logic
});
```

**Impact**: Memory leaks in long-running applications. Each observed property creates an autorun that persists indefinitely.

**Recommendation**: Return a cleanup function or store disposers in a WeakMap keyed by the proxy.

#### 3. Global pendingMutations Array

**Location**: `proxy.ts:69`, `proxy.ts:147`, `proxy.ts:283-290`

**Issue**: Module-level mutable state without isolation.

```typescript
let pendingMutations: string[] = [];
```

**Problems**:
- Could cause race conditions with concurrent mutations
- No error recovery if mutations fail
- Shared state across all reactive instances

**Impact**: Potential tracking bugs in complex scenarios with parallel actions or nested mutations.

**Recommendation**: Use WeakMap keyed by proxy instance or pass mutation context through execution options.

### Moderate Issues

#### 4. Missing Effect Error Handling

**Location**: `proxy.ts:414`

**Issue**: No try-catch around effect execution. Errors won't be captured in the effect event.

```typescript
const funcResult = result.call(target, ...args);
```

**Fix**:
```typescript
let funcResult;
let error = null;
try {
  funcResult = result.call(target, ...args);
} catch (e) {
  error = e;
  throw e; // Re-throw after capturing
}
```

#### 5. Lost Path Context in Arrays

**Location**: `proxy.ts:63`

**Issue**: Nested objects in arrays accessed outside actions lose their path.

```typescript
return createProxy(result, [], observer); // Empty path!
```

**Impact**: Devtools cannot show proper path for nested array items when accessed in non-action context.

**Should be**:
```typescript
return createProxy(result, path.concat(String(key)), observer);
```

#### 6. Async Actions Can Leak

**Location**: `proxy.ts:490-528`

**Issue**: No timeout or cancellation for async actions. Promises that never resolve will hold references indefinitely.

**Impact**: Potential memory leaks with hanging promises.

**Recommendation**: Add AbortController support or timeout mechanism.

#### 7. Computed Called Unnecessarily

**Location**: `proxy.ts:242`, `proxy.ts:274`

**Issue**: `computedValue.get()` is called during setup, then again when the property getter is invoked.

```typescript
const computedValue = computed(() => { ... });
// ...
return computedValue.get(); // First call
```

**Impact**: Minor performance overhead. First call seems redundant since property getter will call it anyway.

### Minor Issues / Limitations

#### 8. No Symbol Property Observation

**Location**: `proxy.ts:51-53`, `proxy.ts:194-196`

**Issue**: Symbol-keyed properties bypass all observation.

```typescript
if (typeof key === "symbol") {
  return result;
}
```

**Impact**: Intentional limitation but not documented. Symbols won't trigger any observer events.

#### 9. No Property Deletion Events

**Issue**: Deletions are blocked but no event is emitted to the observer.

**Impact**: Cannot observe deletion attempts, which might be useful for debugging.

**Recommendation**: Add `propertyDelete` event type.

#### 10. Descriptor Setter Check May Miss Cases

**Location**: `proxy.ts:121-123`, `proxy.ts:141-144`

**Issue**: Only tracks mutations on properties with explicit setter descriptors.

```typescript
const descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(target, key);
if (!descriptor?.set) {
  return result;
}
```

**Impact**: Plain object properties might not have explicit setters defined initially, potentially missing legitimate mutations.

#### 11. State Event De-duplication Logic

**Location**: `proxy.ts:296-302`

**Issue**: Prevents state events when class instance reference doesn't change.

```typescript
if (!isFirstRun && value === newValue && isCustomClassInstance(value)) {
  return;
}
```

**Impact**: Could miss internal state changes within the same class instance if the instance reference remains the same.

## Architecture Analysis

### Strengths

- Well-structured event system with clear type definitions
- Comprehensive tracking of actions, mutations, and effects
- Good separation between readonly and mutation contexts
- Integration with MobX for reactive tracking

### Weaknesses

- Global state management (proxyCache, pendingMutations)
- No cleanup/disposal mechanism
- Observer tied to proxy cache, limiting flexibility
- Path tracking inconsistencies

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (High Priority)

1. **Add autorun disposal mechanism**
   - Return cleanup function from `createObjectProxy`
   - Store disposers in WeakMap keyed by proxy

2. **Isolate pendingMutations**
   - Use WeakMap per proxy instance
   - Or pass mutation context through execution options

3. **Add try-catch to effect proxy**
   - Capture errors in effect events
   - Location: `proxy.ts:414`

4. **Fix array path tracking**
   - Pass correct path in `createArrayProxy` get trap
   - Location: `proxy.ts:63`

### Architecture Improvements (Medium Priority)

1. **Per-instance observer context**
   - Decouple observer from proxy cache
   - Allow same object with different observers

2. **Add AbortController support**
   - Enable cancellation of async action tracking
   - Prevent memory leaks from hanging promises

3. **Document limitations**
   - Symbol property handling
   - Proxy caching behavior
   - Observer scope

### API Enhancements (Low Priority)

1. **Add `propertyDelete` event type**
   - Track deletion attempts
   - Useful for debugging

2. **Add `error` field to `action:end` events**
   - Currently only in `operator:end`
   - Helps track action-level failures

3. **Include parent mutation context**
   - Add parent action/execution info to nested mutations
   - Better understanding of mutation chains

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Observer Implementation

```typescript
import { reactive, ReactiveObserver, ReactiveEvent } from 'reactx';

class LoggingObserver implements ReactiveObserver {
  onEvent(event: ReactiveEvent): void {
    console.log(`[${event.type}]`, event.data);
  }
}

const state = reactive(new MyClass(), { observer: new LoggingObserver() });
```

### Devtools Integration

```typescript
import { reactive } from 'reactx';
import { DevtoolsObserver } from 'reactx/devtools';

const observer = new DevtoolsObserver('localhost:3031', 'my-app');
const state = reactive(new MyClass(), { observer });
```

## Testing Coverage

The test suite (`proxy.test.ts`) covers:
- Basic reactivity and observability
- Custom class instances with methods and getters
- Nested structures (objects, arrays)
- Proxy caching
- Observer events for actions

**Missing test coverage**:
- Memory leak scenarios
- Concurrent mutation handling
- Observer switching/replacement
- Error handling in effects
- Async action cleanup

## Conclusion

The ReactiveObserver system provides powerful introspection capabilities for reactive state management. However, several critical issues around memory management, global state, and path tracking need to be addressed for production use. The recommended fixes focus on cleanup mechanisms, state isolation, and improved error handling.
